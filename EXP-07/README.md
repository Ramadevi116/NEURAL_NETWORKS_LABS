# <p align="center"> ROC CURVE PLOT </p>
## Aim:
   To write python code to plot ROC curve used in ANN.
## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner /Google Colab

## Related Theory Concept:
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is frequently used for evaluating the performance of binary classification algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of a classifier’s performance, rather than a single value like most other metrics.
First, let’s establish that in binary classification, there are four possible outcomes for a test prediction: true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative.
The ROC curve is produced by calculating and plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate for a single classifier at a variety of thresholds.

#### Uses of ROC Curve :
One advantage presented by ROC curves is that they aid us in finding a classification threshold that suits our specific problem.

On the other hand, if our classifier is predicting whether someone has a terminal illness, we might be ok with a higher number of false positives (incorrectly diagnosing the illness), just to make sure that we don’t miss any true positives (people who actually have the illness).

## Algorithm
1. Import Necessary Packages
2. Load the Data
3. Create Training and Test Samples
4. Fit the Logistic Regression Model
5. Model Diagnostics

## Program:
```
/*
Program to plot Receiver Operating Characteristic [ROC] Curve.
Developed by   : P.Ramadevi
RegisterNumber :  212219040119
*/
```
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import metrics 
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Statology/Python-Guides/main/default.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)


x=data[['student','balance','income']]

y=data['default']
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test,= train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=0)
log_regression= LogisticRegression()
log_regression.fit(x_train,y_train)
#define metrics
y_pred_proba=log_regression.predict_proba(x_test)[::,1]
fpr,tpr, _ = metrics.roc_curve(y_test,y_pred_proba)

plt.plot(fpr,tpr)
plt.ylabel("True Positive Rate")
plt.xlabel("False Positive Rate")

plt.show()

#define metrics
y_pred_proba=log_regression.predict_proba(x_test)[::,1]
fpr,tpr, _ = metrics.roc_curve(y_test,y_pred_proba)
auc = metrics.roc_auc_score(y_test,y_pred_proba)


plt.plot(fpr,tpr, label="AUC" + str(auc))
plt.ylabel("True Positive Rate")
plt.xlabel("False Positive Rate")
plt.legend(loc=4)

plt.show()
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the python program successully plotted Receiver Operating Characteristic [ROC] Curve.
